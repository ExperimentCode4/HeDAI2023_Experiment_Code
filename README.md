### PRICAI Experimental Code
This repository contains two fundamental parts with one README each for setup, configuration, and running the software.
- datasetmodule: This module is responsible for creating EHR graphs from the dataset MIMIC-IV
- hgnnmodule: This module is responsible for running experiments on the extracted EHR graphs

Start off by reading and setting up the datasetmodule, then continue with the ghnnmodule.  
All steps for setting up the modules are included in the readmes located within the module folders.
